# Plum's technical interview

Hi ðŸ‘‹, thanks for taking the time to join this interview. 
Here at Plum, we believe that anyone can learn new technologies easily, so we don't want to focus on that.

However, we like pair-programming as we believe collaboration is the key to success. ðŸš€
On this interview, we will work together to solve one of those [katas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming))
so everybody can learn something new and figure out if both sides would enjoy working together. 

Best of luck! We hope you enjoy this interview ðŸ––.
